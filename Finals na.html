<div class = "title ">Mussles</div>
<p>Mussels are an orange fleshy animal protected inside two dark shells. They can close their shells so they don’t dry out when the tide drops, leaving them out of the water. Mussels are normally around 3cm long, but can grow up to 8cm.</p>

<div class = "title ">Shrimps</div>
<p>A shrimp is a small shellfish with long legs and a long body that has a hard casing. Shrimp don't have a backbone like you do. In fact, they don't have a skeleton inside their body at all. Instead, they have a hard, shell-like covering called an exoskeleton that protects them and gives their body its shape.</p>
